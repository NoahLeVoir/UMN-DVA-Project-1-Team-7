## Project Title:

### UFO Sightings: What are aliens up to these days??



## Project Description/Overview
Our project is to uncover patterns in UFO sightings in North America. Weâ€™ll examine relationships between certain areas and the number of sightings; number of sightings throughout across each month of the year, and across each hour the day; and any other related questions, as the data permits. We would like to visualize our findings with the use of bar graphs, line charts, heatmaps, and other appropriate representations.

## Data
We are using a csv file of UFO sightings around the world
    - The csv was provided from: https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings
